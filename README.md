# Vanvis (temp name)

A little pixel drawing app based on the projects 'make 8 bit art' and 'goya'.

This project was mostly an experiment for me to start learning / using canvas and cljs. Currently pretty messy and not super clear, but
plan on adding lots of UI elements to make this more in the vein of a 'kid pix' style drawing app.
